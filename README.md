### Task Requirements

Over a period of 3 days (72 hours), you will need to develop a simple web-based application using the following technologies:

#### Frontend: HTML5 + CSS + JavaScript
- The application must follow HTML5 standard.
- You can choose any CSS framework to styling the frontend page.
- JavaScript is required to demonstrate the ability to dynamically update the web page without reloading the page through AJAJ principles. React.js is desirable.
- Demonstrate a simple Click interface.


#### Task Description
A simple to-do list web-based application that allows the user to manage multiple to-do lists.
- User can create/edit/delete multiple to-do lists on one page.
- Users can click an item to cross it out. A subsequent click restores its original, uncrossed appearance.
- Each to-do list has its own list name.
- Each item in a to-do list contains two attributes: title and description.
- Title is a mandatory field. Description is an optional field. When the description is empty, only show the item title.
- Each item has a checkbox to indicate whether the item has been done or not.
- Any changes (e.g., the status of to-do item, edit item information) made on the web page need to be saved through useState.

#### Submission
- The submission deadline is 72 hours after receiving this email.
- Your submission should be a zipped copy of your project and a simple documentation of how to deploy.
- Email the zipped file to start@joidea.com
